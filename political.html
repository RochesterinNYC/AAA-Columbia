<br><p><h5>The Asian American Alliance Political Committee seeks to...</h5></p>
<br><p>... heighten awareness of issues affecting the Asian Pacific Islander American community in New York City and beyond, issues such as affordable housing, education, LGBTQ rights, mental health, voting rights/civic participation, labor reform, domestic violence, healthcare, environmental justice, etc.</p>
<br><p>... become a catalyst for social change by organizing around such issues and, by the same token, support progressive APA (and non-APA) political candidates who advance such issues by means of legislation and public policy.</p>
<br><p>... tackle cultural stereotypes and discrimination and eradicate them by facilitating open and honest dialogue about the causes of such bias in the media, literature, and other societal milieu.</p>
<br><p>... build coalitions with like-minded campus organizations and ally with other students of color.</p>
<br><p>... research, study and chronicle the history of Asian Americans in the United States, thereupon promoting the awareness of APA history among our fellow students and allies.</p>
<br><p>... and lastly, though perhaps most importantly, explore what it means to be Asian American (whether we believe this term to be legitimately applicable to all APAs or otherwise) and what it means to be an “Asian American” in society today.</p>
