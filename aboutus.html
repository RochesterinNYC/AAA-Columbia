<br><p><h5>BY THE NUMBERS</h5></p>
<br><p>One of the largest organizations at Columbia University, the Asian American Alliance has over 1,200 members on its mailing list represented by all schools and disciplines of the undergraduate, graduate, faculty, and administrative population of the University as well as individuals and organizations beyond Columbia. Our executive board comprises of 30 students from Columbia College (CC), the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and Barnard College (BC).</p>
<br><p>The Asian American Alliance works with groups of all types and of all backgrounds including student of color organizations, progressive groups, student government, political organizations, community service organizations, off campus groups, student conferences, and the University administration.</p>
<br><p><h5>OUR MISSION</h5></p>
<br><p>Founded in the spring of 1995, the Asian American Alliance (AAA) is a student organization that strives to serve the Asian Pacific American (APA) community at Columbia University. AAA is a collaborative organization that seeks to work with APA and all students of color groups at Columbia to reach out to members of the university and the outside community at large. In this way, we aim to promote understanding, foster dialogue and create a sense of awareness within Columbia University.</p>
<br><p>Our purpose is to educate ourselves and others, to organize and to mobilize. We seek to cultivate a common understanding and a greater respect for the APA community.</p>
<br><p>The APA community at Columbia University is in a perpetual state of transformation. Inherent in the structure and goals of our organization is the ability to change in conjunction with evolving issues facing the APA community. Nevertheless, AAA will remain true to its fundamental goal of serving our community by dedicating itself and its resources to student activism.</p>
