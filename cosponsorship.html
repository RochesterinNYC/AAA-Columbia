<br><p><h5><center>The Asian American Alliance Co-Sponsorship Fund</center></h5></p>
<br><p>The Asian American Alliance Co-Sponsorship Fund is designed to provide monetary funds for any student event that is related to the Asian American community here at Columbia and/or off campus.</p>
<br><p>We are interested in co-sponsoring events that address one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>- Cover topics that relate to the Asian American experience.</li>
  <li>- Build a greater sense of community among Asian Americans at Columbia.</li>
  <li>- Contribute to the relationship between the Asian American community and the general Columbia community on campus.</li>
</ul>
<br><p>AAA Co-Sponsorships are available by e-mail. All interested groups must submit their proposal, with the e-mail subject title "AAA EVENT CO-SPONSORSHIP," to the Executive Board (<a href="mailto:aaa@columbia.edu">aaa@columbia.edu</a>) at least one week prior to the date of the event. We would like to see a part of the proposal specifically explaining how your event relates to and/or contributes to the Asian American community here at Columbia or off campus.</p>
<br><p>Within a week of submission, the event organizer or a representative will be encouraged to arrange a time to briefly present their proposal before the AAA Board, which meets on Tuesday evenings, between 8-9PM in Board Room 503 (Lerner 5th floor). Such presentations are optional, but strongly recommended. Members of the board will then review and reach a final decision on your proposal.</p>
<br><p>In good faith to our community at Columbia, AAA will remain committed to publicizing and providing manpower for any event organized by friends and affiliates of AAA, regardless of an application or a co-sponsorship decision. Please inform us on how we can help your event by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:aaa@columbia.edu">aaa@columbia.edu</a>.</p>
